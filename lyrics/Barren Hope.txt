[Intro]
By the river she sat down
Waiting for the sky to turn blue
She saw the city line masked in smoke
Felt her fear rising as darkness grew
Still she hoped

[Chorus]
That when dawn comes
The sky will be filled with orange hue
For in her dreams
The water was clear and the sky was still blue.

[Verse]
She walks barefoot through the corridor
The cold sensation of the floor
Running her fingers on the wall
She stumbles through the house
Trying not to fall.

She blows off the dust and picks up a detuned guitar
Trying to recall a tune
But symphonies are lost in the scar.
So she pluck strings at random
But hears no sound
She finally keeps the old thing down
And tries to look around

A room covered in darkness
An existence swallowed by nothingness
And standing in the dust filled corner
The burden of being alive

Waiting. Wishing.

[Chorus]
That when dawn comes
The sky will be filled with orange hue
For in her dreams
The water is clear and the sky is still blue.
