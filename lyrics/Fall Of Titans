[Chorus]
Houses collapse empires fall
Crumbling in the dirt
Monuments that once stood tall

[Verse]
All the glory was yours
Yours will be the shame
Go ahead point your fingers
No one left to blame
We are pawns of time
Helpless victims of its decay
Words stripped from our minds
A million voice
With nothing left to say

[Chorus] x2
Houses collapse empires fall
Crumbling in the dirt
Monuments that once stood tall
