[Chorus]
I have lived and died again
I'm too tired to hide again
An ocean rages in me
There's thunderstorm inside again

[Verse]
The void cuts through my flesh
And feeds on my soul
I witness in silence
As it devours me whole

I knew I'd I lose
Yet I tried again
I open my arms to embrace
The darkness within
And outside again

[Chorus]
I have lived and died again
I'm too tired to hide again
An ocean rages in me
There's thunderstorm inside again

[Verse]
I have always been a coward
No wonder I lied again
You hated me, called me names
Maybe you cried again

I stumble through space
Fumbling across time
A crooked continuum
Without you
Could never be sublime

Million reasons to die
To live but a few
How Do you escape the devil
That lives inside you


Something to cling to
Something to hold
Through the lonely summer
And blistering cold
When the sky pours on you
A merciless rain

[Chorus]
I have lived and died again
I'm too tired to hide again
An ocean rages in me
There's thunderstorm inside again
